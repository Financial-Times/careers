# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ We're FT Tech

In FT Tech we develop products like FT.com, our [award-winning website](https://aboutus.ft.com/en-gb/announcements/ft-technology-wins-at-devops-digiday-awards/) and one of the [fastest news sites](https://webperf.xyz/) in the world. We are firm supporters of open source and develop more and more of our projects [in the open](https://github.com/Financial-Times) every day. Some of our most widely used OSS are [Polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/) and [Origami](http://origami.ft.com/).

We are hundreds of engineers, but our teams are small, self-governing and multi-disciplined, empowered to choose our own tech stack and to continuously deploy our software, sometimes hundreds of times a day.

Our projects are widely varied in scale and scope -- you could choose to work on anything from an internal bot with a couple of hundred users, to a system with 4.2 billion requests per month -- using [microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC5SfTMFK3M), [machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iPP2tltt-0), [augmented reality](https://labs.ft.com/experiment/2017/06/06/inklink.html), and more.

Our ideal candidate will bring a unique point of view to the work we do. We don't hire for team fit, we hire for team _betterment_; diverse perspectives help us build a great product, and even better teams.

## Your FT Tech Career

We firmly believe that the success of our products and teams is strictly tied to the success of our people. In FT Tech we invest in you as an individual at every step of your career, supporting your professional growth as well as your personal development.

Most engineers that move into senior tech leadership positions in FT Technology every year have started out in more junior roles. Throughout their FT careers theyâ€™ve acquired not just the technical skills required for complex new challenges, but also the professional and social skills to support the development of newer junior members.

As part of FT Tech you will have access to all of the support and tools you need to have a successful, growing career with us, as well as those you may want to leverage to support the growth of others around you.

You will also have the opportunity and our support to attend (and speak at, if youâ€™re inclined) world-renowned tech conferences to further develop your skills every year. Furthermore, youâ€™ll have access to fully funded professional certifications, internal and external workshops and tech talks.

### Our Culture

We are passionate about building technical solutions to ultimately enable the highest quality of journalism. As a team we believe trusted high quality journalism plays an important role in a post-truth, post-fact world.

We are a vibrant and diverse group of people from different backgrounds, and with different interests outside of tech. There are over 2,200 employees across our offices (London, Sofia, New York, Manila, Tokyo, Hong Kong), and we are [deeply committed to furthering equality and diversity](https://aboutus.ft.com/en-gb/careers/diversity-and-inclusion-ft/), not just in our organization, but in the wider tech industry. FT is part of the [Tech Talent Charter](https://techtalentcharter.co.uk/), where we have committed to reaching gender parity within the Product & Technology department by 2022.

We make it our priority to provide the most flexible conditions for everyone, including flexible working hours, the capacity to work from home when needed, part-time flexibility for almost all our roles (from junior to director), a 35-hour work week, 10% time and more.

We have very active communities which you are welcome to participate in such as [FT Women](https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/inspirational-women-of-ft-product-technology-62db31b67980), FT Embrace (our BAME network), Proud FT, and ad-hoc social events such as regular board games and quiz nights, netball, rounders and football.

### Open Roles

We have roles available from **Junior Engineer** to **Principal Engineer** in Internal Products (IP).

Senior engineers often lead them or projects within them.  

Most of our dev work happens in Node, but you don't need specific experience in JS to join us. We believe programming skills are highly transferable. Are you proficient in another programming language and want to switch to node? Join us! We'll support you in the transition in any role.
